          MitchCo Construction, Inc. was started by Mitch Joa in 1989. We have been successfully
          meeting the needs of commercial and residential property owners alike for over 30 years
          for one simple reason: we understand the demands of this industry. After decades of
          experience providing our customers quality concrete installations, we've shifted our focus
          to the quick and professional removal of asphalt and concrete for businesses and
          homeowners alike. This allows cement contractors to get to their work site with no
          interference of existing sidewalks, driveways, curbs, foundations, and more. We'll even
          move earth if needed so that the job can start on time, every time. Whether the job is big
          or small, we confidently handle the removal of concrete, asphalt, and earth.
